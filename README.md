1. [Blank Screen](01.html)
2. [Stationary Circle](02.html)
3. [Moving Circle](03.html)
4. [Boundary](04.html)
5. [Keyboard](05.html)
6. [Cursors](06.html)
7. [Control](07.html)

## Method
Repetitive drills. Repeat each drill 3 to 5 times per class. Start
with a blank editor at the beginning of each drill each time 
the student types in the drill.
Delay explanation of learning objectives until after child can type in
drills from a blank screen.

## Target Student
12 year old girl.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Blank Screen:** `<script>` tag in HTML, script src, script type, 
variable assignment to object,  
 [object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects)
instantiation
2. **Stationary Circle:** x,y coordinate system,
variable declaration, function creation, 
hex color codes, color picker, class methods
3. **Moving Circle:** physics constructor, Arcade Physics (which is enabled
by default), update loop (even though the loop is hidden), velocity versus 
x,y mapping
4. **Boundary:** bounds detection based on x,y coordinate and collision detection
5. **Keyboard:** keyboard boolean attributes, if statement with understanding of
true/false condition, JavaScript console log for debugging, chrome dev tools
overview
6. **Cursors:** else if, else, Phaser debug system, review x,y coordinate system,
boolean variables
7. **Control:** object velocity in x,y coordinate space.

## Other Topics

* Explain [httpster](https://github.com/SimbCo/httpster) and 
[fenix web server](http://fenixwebserver.com/) for testing. httpster requires
installation of node and npm
* Explain screen updates (clearing screen) and clock, which is hidden
by the Phaser update function.

## Future Level 2 Drills 
1. for and while loops by creating multiple rectangles
as obstacles
2. collision detection
3. sprites
4. animation: lists, loops
